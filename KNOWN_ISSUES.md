# ![KNOWN ISSUES](https://i.imgur.com/7O8qpvQ.png)

This file tracks known bugs and limitations. Some may be fixed in future updates.
*Last updated: 10/6/2026*

---

## Scanning

* **Converted videos detected as songs** — Files that were originally videos but converted to audio (e.g. MP4 to MP3) are indexed as normal tracks. Remove them from the library if you don't want them.

---

## Performance

* **UI slow under heavy system load** — Lokal draws with the graphics card. Games or other graphics-heavy apps running alongside it can make the UI stutter. Raising Lokal's process priority (Windows) may help, and turning off **Glass** (Settings › Appearance › Player Bar) lightens the load.

* **Rapid skipping during a crossfade** — Skipping several tracks quickly while a crossfade is running may briefly interrupt the smoothing.

---

## Playback

* **Volume during a crossfade** — Rapidly pausing/unpausing or changing the volume while a crossfade is running may cause small volume jumps while it re-syncs.

* **Crossfade under extreme load** — Heavy CPU usage can affect how smooth a crossfade sounds.

---

## Library

* **Artist images on first load** — Artist pictures fall back to album covers. Before the first full scan and lookup, some artists may show without a picture.

---

## Metadata

* **Songs without a genre** — Genres come from the file's tags or an online lookup. Settings › Library › Genres › **Fill In Genres** looks up the missing ones (and replaces the placeholder "Music" some files carry); songs iTunes doesn't know stay without one. You can set any genre yourself with **Set Genres**.

---

## Downloader

* **Playlist progress** — Progress for large playlists depends on what `yt-dlp` reports, so it can jump.

* **Error messages** — When `ffmpeg` or `yt-dlp` fails, the message doesn't always say why. Common causes (unreadable browser cookies, for example) are explained.

---

## Lyrics

* **No new lyrics offline** — Lyrics can't be fetched without an internet connection. Lyrics already fetched keep working.

* **Wrong lyrics version** — A source may return another version (live, remix, radio edit). Lookups use the song's length and album to avoid it; when it happens, use the search in the lyrics view.

* **Timing for plain lyrics** — For lyrics without timestamps, **Time Plain Lyrics** (Settings › Playback › Lyrics) estimates the timing; it may not line up exactly.

* **Cached lyrics fetched again** — In rare cases cached lyrics aren't found in the cache and are fetched again. The console logs show the cache status.

---

## Networking

* **Rate limits** — Many lyric searches or metadata lookups in a short time can fail for a while because of the services' rate limits.

* **Beatport sign-in** — Beatport has no public developer sign-up, so Lokal signs in with the client ID of Beatport's own API docs page. If Beatport changes that page, password sign-in can stop working: use the *Token* tab instead.

* **My Shazams** — Shazam's website no longer shows your Shazams. Without an Apple Music subscription, import the data export from shazam.com/privacy (it can take days to arrive, and accounts that only sync through iCloud may get an empty file) or install Shazam for Mac. Imported Shazams have covers for the newest 150 songs only.

* **Beatport blocked** — An `api.beatport.com` entry in the hosts file (or a blocker) stops Beatport. Lokal says so; remove the entry and restart Lokal.

---

## Web Mode

* **Localhost routing** — Some localhost setups can stop assets or the API from loading in web mode.

* **Artist images not loading** — If `LOKAL_DATA_DIR` is misconfigured, artist images won't load in the browser.
